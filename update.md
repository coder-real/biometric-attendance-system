From the attendance we need to update a few things.

1ow the system checks if the users has signed in on attendance and if yes prevents another sign in.

1. If the user signs in for a partifucalr course, on his attempt to sign in again, isntead of just saying that you have marked attendance it should sign the user out. 
2. The attendance log should update to capture this. There should be column where we have two status sign in and out. like button greyed. so there should be a state checking his attendnace for a class in session. So that if the user signs in , the sign in button small would be gree, and sign out greyed. but when the user signs out the button becomes red. and the sign in is greyed. and the yser cannot again sign in into that class again. until a new session of the class comes up
3. Add a download button at the top corner of the page to allow for download of the the log in CSV format or execel format or even pdf format
